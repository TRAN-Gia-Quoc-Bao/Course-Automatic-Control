# Exercises for Automatic-Control courses
I took two Automatic Control courses. 
Automatic Control 1 (AC1) was about RST-structure PID controller, state-space representation and state-feedback control. Its exercises included some Labs (not uploaded here), a poster defense and two experimental excercises.

Automatic Control 2 (AC2) was about LQR and system identification. 

Contents:

1. AC1 poster about RST-structure PID and state-feedback controller (in English)

2. AC1 experimental exercise "Aerotherme" about RST-structure PID controller (in French)

3. AC1 experimental exercise "Multi-bacs" about state-feedback controller (in French)

4. AC2 experimental exercise "CARV" about system identification and RST-structure PID controller (in French)

5. AC2 experimental exercise "Gyroscope" about state-feedback LQR (in French)
